vte machinelearning ml is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data it is seen as a part of artificial intelligence machinelearning algorithms build a model based on sample data known as training data in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so machinelearning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications such as in medicine email filtering speech recognition and computer vision where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks
a subset of machinelearning is closely related to computational statistics which focuses on making predictions using computers but not all machinelearning is statistical learning the study of mathematical optimization delivers methods theory and application domains to the field of machinelearning datamining is a related field of study focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning some implementations of machinelearning use data and neural networks in a way that mimics the working of a biological brain
in its application across business problems machinelearning is also referred to as predictive analytics

overviewedit
learning algorithms work on the basis that strategies algorithms and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future these inferences can be obvious such as since the sun rose every morning for the last days it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well they can be nuanced such as x of families have geographically separate species with color variants so there is a y chance that undiscovered black swans exist machinelearning programs can perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so it involves computers learning from data provided so that they carry out certain tasks for simple tasks assigned to computers it is possible to program algorithms telling the machine how to execute all steps required to solve the problem at hand on the computers part no learning is needed for more advanced tasks it can be challenging for a human to manually create the needed algorithms in practice it can turn out to be more effective to help the machine develop its own algorithm rather than having human programmers specify every needed step
the discipline of machinelearning employs various approaches to teach computers to accomplish tasks where no fully satisfactory algorithm is available in cases where vast numbers of potential answers exist one approach is to label some of the correct answers as valid this can then be used as training data for the computer to improve the algorithms it uses to determine correct answers for example to train a system for the task of digital character recognition the mnist dataset of handwritten digits has often been used
history and relationships to other fieldsedit
see also timeline of machinelearning the term machinelearning was coined in by arthur samuel an american ibmer and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence also the synonym selfteaching computers was used in this time period a representative book of the machinelearning research during the s was the nilssons book on learning machines dealing mostly with machinelearning for pattern classification interest related to pattern recognition continued into the s as described by duda and hart in in a report was given on using teaching strategies so that a neural network learns to recognize characters letters digits and special symbols from a computer terminal
tom m mitchell provided a widely quoted more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machinelearning field a computer program is said to learn from experience e with respect to some class of tasks t and performance measure p if its performance at tasks in t as measured by p
improves with experience e this definition of the tasks in which machinelearning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms this follows alan turings proposal in his paper computing machinery and intelligence in which the question can machines think is replaced with the question can machines do what we as thinking entities can do
modern day machinelearning has two objectives one is to classify data based on models which have been developed the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models a hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles a machinelearning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions
artificial intelligenceedit machinelearning as subfield of ai
part of machinelearning as subfield of ai or part of ai as subfield of machinelearning as a scientific endeavor machinelearning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence in the early days of ai as an academic discipline some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data they attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods as well as what was then termed neural networks these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics probabilistic reasoning was also employed especially in automated medical diagnosis however an increasing emphasis on the logical knowledgebased approach caused a rift between ai and machinelearning probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation by expert systems had come to dominate ai and statistics was out of favor work on symbolicknowledgebased learning did continue within ai leading to inductive logic programming but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of ai proper in pattern recognition and information retrieval  neural networks research had been abandoned by ai and computer science around the same time this line too was continued outside the aics field as connectionism by researchers from other disciplines including hopfield rumelhart and hinton their main success came in the mids with the reinvention of backpropagation machinelearning ml reorganized as a separate field started to flourish in the s the field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature it shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from ai and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory
the difference between ml and ai is frequently misunderstood ml learns and predicts based on passive observations whereas ai implies an agent interacting with the environment to learn and take actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals
as of many sources continue to assert that ml remains a subfield of ai others have the view that not all ml is part of ai but only an intelligent subset of ml should be considered ai datamining edit machinelearning and datamining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly but while machinelearning focuses on prediction based on known properties learned from the training data datamining focuses on the discovery of previously unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases datamining uses many machinelearning methods but with different goals on the other hand machinelearning also employs datamining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy much of the confusion between these two research communities which do often have separate conferences and separate journals ecml pkdd being a major exception comes from the basic assumptions they work with in machinelearning performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and datamining kdd the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge evaluated with respect to known knowledge an uninformed unsupervised method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical kdd task supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data
optimizationedit machinelearning also has intimate ties to optimization many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances for example in classification one wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples
generalizationedit
the difference between optimization and machinelearning arises from the goal of generalization while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set machinelearning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples characterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research especially for deeplearning algorithms
statisticsedit machinelearning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods but distinct in their principal goal statistics draws population inferences from a sample while machinelearning finds generalizable predictive patterns according to michael i jordan the ideas of machinelearning from methodological principles to theoretical tools have had a long prehistory in statistics he also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field
leo breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms data model and algorithmic model wherein algorithmic model means more or less the machinelearning algorithms like random forest
some statisticians have adopted methods from machinelearning leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning
theoryedit
main articles computational learning theory and statistical learning theory
a core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new unseen examplestasks after having experienced a learning data set the training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution considered representative of the space of occurrences and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases
the computational analysis of machinelearning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms instead probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common the biasvariance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error
for the best performance in the context of generalization the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data if the hypothesis is less complex than the function then the model has under fitted the data if the complexity of the model is increased in response then the training error decreases but if the hypothesis is too complex then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer
in addition to performance bounds learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning in computational learning theory a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time there are two kinds of time complexity results positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time
approachesedit machinelearning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories depending on the nature of the signal or feedback available to the learning system
supervised learning the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs given by a teacher and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs
unsupervised learning no labels are given to the learning algorithm leaving it on its own to find structure in its input unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself discovering hidden patterns in data or a means towards an end feature learning
reinforcement learning a computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent as it navigates its problem space the program is provided feedback thats analogous to rewards which it tries to maximize
supervised learningedit
main article supervised learning
a supportvector machine is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a linear boundary here the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white
supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs the data is known as training data and consists of a set of training examples each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output also known as a supervisory signal
in the mathematical model each training example is represented by an array or vector sometimes called a feature vector and the training data is represented by a matrix through iterative optimization of an objective function supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs an optimal function will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data an algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task
types of supervised learning algorithms include active learning classification and regression classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range as an example for a classification algorithm that filters emails the input would be an incoming email and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email
similarity learning is an area of supervised machinelearning closely related to regression and classification but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are it has applications in ranking recommendation systems visual identity tracking face verification and speaker verification
unsupervised learningedit
main article unsupervised learningsee also cluster analysis
unsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs and find structure in the data like grouping or clustering of data points the algorithms therefore learn from test data that has not been labeled classified or categorized instead of responding to feedback unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data a central application of unsupervised learning is in the field of density estimation in statistics such as finding the probability density function though unsupervised learning encompasses other domains involving summarizing and explaining data features
cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets called clusters so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness or the similarity between members of the same cluster and separation the difference between clusters other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity
semisupervised learningedit
main article semisupervised learning
semisupervised learning falls between unsupervised learning without any labeled training data and supervised learning with completely labeled training data some of the training examples are missing training labels
yet many machinelearning researchers have found that unlabeled data when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy
in weakly supervised learning the training labels are noisy limited or imprecise however these labels are often cheaper to obtain resulting in larger effective training sets
reinforcement learningedit
main article reinforcement learning
reinforcement learning is an area of machinelearning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward due to its generality the field is studied in many other disciplines such as game theory control theory operations research information theory simulationbased optimization multiagent systems swarm intelligence statistics and genetic algorithms in machinelearning the environment is typically represented as a markov decision process mdp many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the mdp and are used when exact models are infeasible reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent
dimensionality reductionedit
dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables in other words it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set also called number of features most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction
one of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis pca
pca involves changing higherdimensional data eg d to a smaller space eg d this results in a smaller dimension of data d instead of d while keeping all original variables in the model without changing the data
the manifold hypothesis proposes that highdimensional data sets lie along lowdimensional manifolds and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularization
other typesedit
other approaches have been developed which dont fit neatly into this threefold categorisation and sometimes more than one is used by the same machinelearning system for example topic modeling
meta learning
as of deeplearning has become the dominant approach for much ongoing work in the field of machinelearning self learningedit
selflearning as a machinelearning paradigm was introduced in along with a neural network capable of selflearning named crossbar adaptive array caa it is a learning with no external rewards and no external teacher advice the caa selflearning algorithm computes in a crossbar fashion both decisions about actions and emotions feelings about consequence situations the system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion
the selflearning algorithm updates a memory matrix w was such that in each iteration executes the following machinelearning routine
in situation s perform an action a
receive consequence situation s 
compute emotion of being in consequence situation vs 
update crossbar memory
w as was vs 
it is a system with only one input situation s and only one output action or behavior a there is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment the backpropagated value secondary reinforcement is the emotion toward the consequence situation the caa exists in two environments one is the behavioral environment where it behaves and the other is the genetic environment wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment after receiving the genome species vector from the genetic environment the caa learns a goalseeking behavior in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations
feature learningedit
main article feature learning
several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training classic examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis feature learning algorithms also called representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful often as a preprocessing step before performing classification or predictions this technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown datagenerating distribution while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution this replaces manual feature engineering and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task
feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised in supervised feature learning features are learned using labeled input data examples include artificial neural networks multilayer perceptrons and supervised dictionary learning in unsupervised feature learning features are learned with unlabeled input data
examples include dictionary learning independent component analysis autoencoders matrix factorization and various forms of clustering
manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is lowdimensional sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn lowdimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data without reshaping them into higherdimensional vectors deeplearning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation or a hierarchy of features with higherlevel more abstract features defined in terms of or generating lowerlevel features it has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data
feature learning is motivated by the fact that machinelearning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process however realworld data such as images video and sensory data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features an alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination without relying on explicit algorithms
sparse dictionary learningedit
main article sparse dictionary learning
sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and is assumed to be a sparse matrix the method is strongly nphard and difficult to solve approximately a popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the ksvd algorithm sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts in classification the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs for a dictionary where each class has already been built a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image denoising the key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary but the noise cannot
anomaly detectionedit
main article anomaly detection
in datamining anomaly detection also known as outlier detection is the identification of rare items events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data typically the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud a structural defect medical problems or errors in a text anomalies are referred to as outliers novelties noise deviations and exceptions
in particular in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection the interesting objects are often not rare objects but unexpected bursts of inactivity this pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object and many outlier detection methods in particular unsupervised algorithms will fail on such data unless it has been aggregated appropriately instead a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the microclusters formed by these patterns
three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal by looking for instances that seem to fit least to the remainder of the data set supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as normal and abnormal and involves training a classifier the key difference to many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection semisupervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model
robot learningedit
robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machinelearning methods starting from supervised learning reinforcement learning and finally metalearning eg maml
association rulesedit
main article association rule learningsee also inductive logic programming
association rule learning is a rulebased machinelearning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases it is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of interestingness
rulebased machinelearning is a general term for any machinelearning method that identifies learns or evolves rules to store manipulate or apply knowledge the defining characteristic of a rulebased machinelearning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system this is in contrast to other machinelearning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction rulebased machinelearning approaches include learning classifier systems association rule learning and artificial immune systems
based on the concept of strong rules rakesh agrawal tomasz imieli ski and arun swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in largescale transaction data recorded by pointofsale pos systems in supermarkets for example the rule o

learning classifier systems lcs are a family of rulebased machinelearning algorithms that combine a discovery component typically a genetic algorithm with a learning component performing either supervised learning reinforcement learning or unsupervised learning they seek to identify a set of contextdependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions
inductive logic programming ilp is an approach to rulelearning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples background knowledge and hypotheses given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts an ilp system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses and not only logic programming such as functional programs
inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing gordon plotkin and ehud shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machinelearning in a logical setting shapiro built their first implementation model inference system in a prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples the term inductive here refers to philosophical induction suggesting a theory to explain observed facts rather than mathematical induction proving a property for all members of a wellordered set
modelsedit
performing machinelearning involves creating a model which is trained on some training data and then can process additional data to make predictions various types of models have been used and researched for machinelearning systems
artificial neural networksedit
main article artificial neural networksee also deeplearning an artificial neural network is an interconnected group of nodes akin to the vast network of neurons in a brain here each circular node represents an artificial neuron and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another
artificial neural networks anns or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains such systems learn to perform tasks by considering examples generally without being programmed with any taskspecific rules
an ann is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain each connection like the synapses in a biological brain can transmit information a signal from one artificial neuron to another an artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it in common ann implementations the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some nonlinear function of the sum of its inputs the connections between artificial neurons are called edges artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds the weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold typically artificial neurons are aggregated into layers different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs signals travel from the first layer the input layer to the last layer the output layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times
the original goal of the ann approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would however over time attention moved to performing specific tasks leading to deviations from biology artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks including computer vision speech recognition machine translation social network filtering playing board and video games and medical diagnosis deeplearning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network this approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing some successful applications of deeplearning are computer vision and speech recognition
decision treesedit
main article decision tree learning
decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item represented in the branches to conclusions about the items target value represented in the leaves it is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics datamining and machinelearning tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees in these tree structures leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values typically real numbers are called regression trees in decision analysis a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making in datamining a decision tree describes data but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making
supportvector machinesedit
main article supportvector machine
supportvector machines svms also known as supportvector networks are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression given a set of training examples each marked as belonging to one of two categories an svm training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other
an svm training algorithm is a nonprobabilistic binary linear classifier although methods such as platt scaling exist to use svm in a probabilistic classification setting in addition to performing linear classification svms can efficiently perform a nonlinear classification using what is called the kernel trick implicitly mapping their inputs into highdimensional feature spaces
illustration of linear regression on a data set
regression analysisedit
main article regression analysis
regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features its most common form is linear regression where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares the latter is often extended by regularization mathematics methods to mitigate overfitting and bias as in ridge regression when dealing with nonlinear problems goto models include polynomial regression for example used for trendline fitting in microsoft excel logistic regression often used in statistical classification or even kernel regression which introduces nonlinearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higherdimensional space
bayesian networksedit
main article bayesian network
a simple bayesian network rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet
a bayesian network belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph dag for example a bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms given symptoms the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning bayesian networks that model sequences of variables like speech signals or protein sequences are called dynamic bayesian networks generalizations of bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams
genetic algorithmsedit
main article genetic algorithm
a genetic algorithm ga is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem in machinelearning genetic algorithms were used in the s and s conversely machinelearning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms
training modelsedit
typically machinelearning models require a high quantity of reliable data in order for the models to perform accurate predictions when training a machinelearning model machinelearning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative sample of data data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text a collection of images sensor data and data collected from individual users of a service overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machinelearning model trained models derived from biased or nonevaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions bias models may result in detrimental outcomes thereby furthering the negative impacts to society or objectives algorithmic bias is a potential result from data not fully prepared for training machinelearning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably be integrated within machinelearning engineering teams
federated learningedit
main article federated learning
federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machinelearning models that decentralizes the training process allowing for users privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server this also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices for example gboard uses federated machinelearning to train search query prediction models on users mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to google

limitationsedit
although machinelearning has been transformative in some fields machinelearning programs often fail to deliver expected results reasons for this are numerous lack of suitable data lack of access to the data data bias privacy problems badly chosen tasks and algorithms wrong tools and people lack of resources and evaluation problems
in a selfdriving car from uber failed to detect a pedestrian who was killed after a collision attempts to use machinelearning in healthcare with the ibm watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested machinelearning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature while it has improved with training sets it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves
biasedit
main article algorithmic bias machinelearning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases a machinelearning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data when trained on manmade data machinelearning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society language models learned from data have been shown to contain humanlike biases machinelearning systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people in google photos would often tag black people as gorillas and in this still was not well resolved but google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all similar issues with recognizing nonwhite people have been found in many other systems in microsoft tested a chatbot that learned from twitter and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language because of such challenges the effective use of machinelearning may take longer to be adopted in other domains concern for fairness in machinelearning that is reducing bias in machinelearning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists including feifei li who reminds engineers that there s nothing artificial about aiit s inspired by people it s created by people and most importantly it impacts people it is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand and that is a profound responsibility 
overfittingedit
main article overfitting
the blue line could be an example of overfitting a linear function due to random noise
settling on a bad overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is
other limitationsedit
learners can also disappoint by learning the wrong lesson a toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses a realworld example is that unlike humans current image classifiers often dont primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in adversarial images that the system misclassifies
adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems or from nonpattern perturbations some systems are so brittle that changing a single adversarial pixel predictably induces misclassification

classification of machinelearning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method which splits the data in a training and test set conventionally training set and test set designation and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set in comparison the kfoldcrossvalidation method randomly partitions the data into k subsets and then k experiments are performed each respectively considering subset for evaluation and the remaining k subsets for training the model in addition to the holdout and crossvalidation methods bootstrap which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset can be used to assess model accuracy
in addition to overall accuracy investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning true positive rate tpr and true negative rate tnr respectively similarly investigators sometimes report the false positive rate fpr as well as the false negative rate fnr however these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators the total operating characteristic toc is an effective method to express a models diagnostic ability toc shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates thus toc provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic roc and rocs associated area under the curve auc
ethicsedit
see also ai control problem and toronto declaration machinelearning poses a host of ethical questions systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use algorithmic bias thus digitizing cultural prejudices for example in the uks commission for racial equality found that st georges medical school had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and this program had denied nearly candidates who were found to be either women or had noneuropean sounding names using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machinelearning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machinelearning ai can be wellequipped to make decisions in technical fields which rely heavily on data and historical information these decisions rely on objectivity and logical reasoning because human languages contain biases machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases
other forms of ethical challenges not related to personal biases are seen in health care there are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the publics interest but as incomegenerating machines this is especially true in the united states where there is a longstanding ethical dilemma of improving health care but also increasing profits for example the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithms proprietary owners hold stakes there is
potential for machinelearning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose medicate and plan recovery paths for patients but this requires these biases to be mitigated
hardwareedit
since the s advances in both machinelearning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks a particular narrow subdomain of machinelearning that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units by graphic processing units gpus often with aispecific enhancements had displaced cpus as the dominant method of training largescale commercial cloud ai openai estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deeplearning projects from alexnet to alphazero and found a fold increase in the amount of compute required with a doublingtime trendline of months
neuromorphicphysical neural networksedit
a physical neural network or neuromorphic computer
is a type of artificial neural network in which an electrically adjustable material is used to emulate the function of a neural synapse physical neural network is used to emphasize the reliance on physical hardware used to emulate neurons as opposed to softwarebased approaches more generally the term is applicable to other artificial neural networks in which a memristor or other electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate a neural synapse
embedded machinelearning edit
embedded machinelearning is a subfield of machinelearning where the machinelearning model is run on embedded systems with limited computing resources such as wearable computers edge devices and microcontrollers running machinelearning model in embedded devices removes the need for transferring and storing data on cloud servers for further processing henceforth reducing data breaches and privacy leaks happening because of transferring data and also minimizes theft of intellectual properties personal data and business secrets embedded machinelearning could be applied through several techniques including hardware acceleration using approximate computing optimization of machinelearning models and many more
