outline of machinelearning vte datamining is a process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machinelearning statistics and database systems datamining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal of extracting information with intelligent methods from a data set and transform the information into a comprehensible structure for further use datamining is the analysis step of the knowledge discovery in databases process or kdd aside from the raw analysis step it also involves database and data management aspects data preprocessing model and inference considerations interestingness metrics complexity considerations postprocessing of discovered structures visualization and online updating
the term datamining is a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data not the extraction mining of data itself it also is a buzzword and is frequently applied to any form of largescale data or information processing collection extraction warehousing analysis and statistics as well as any application of computer decision support system including artificial intelligence eg machinelearning and business intelligence the book datamining practical machinelearning tools and techniques with java which covers mostly machinelearning material was originally to be named just practical machinelearning and the term datamining was only added for marketing reasons often the more general terms large scale data analysis and analytics or when referring to actual methods artificial intelligence and machinelearning  are more appropriate
the actual datamining task is the semiautomatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown interesting patterns such as groups of data records cluster analysis unusual records anomaly detection and dependencies association rule mining sequential pattern mining this usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices these patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data and may be used in further analysis or for example in machinelearning and predictive analytics for example the datamining step might identify multiple groups in the data which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system neither the data collection data preparation nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the datamining step but do belong to the overall kdd process as additional steps
the difference between data analysis and datamining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset eg analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign regardless of the amount of data in contrast datamining uses machinelearning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data
the related terms data dredging data fishing and data snooping refer to the use of datamining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are or may be too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered these methods can however be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations

etymologyedit
in the s statisticians and economists used terms like data fishing or data dredging to refer to what they considered the bad practice of analyzing data without an apriori hypothesis the term datamining was used in a similarly critical way by economist michael lovell in an article published in the review of economic studies in lovell indicates that the practice masquerades under a variety of aliases ranging from experimentation positive to fishing or snooping negative
the term datamining appeared around in the database community generally with positive connotations for a short time in s a phrase database mining  was used but since it was trademarked by hnc a san diegobased company to pitch their database mining workstation researchers consequently turned to datamining other terms used include data archaeology information harvesting information discovery knowledge extraction etc gregory piatetskyshapiro coined the term knowledge discovery in databases for the first workshop on the same topic kdd and this term became more popular in ai and machinelearning community however the term datamining became more popular in the business and press communities currently the terms datamining and knowledge discovery are used interchangeably
in the academic community the major forums for research started in when the first international conference on datamining and knowledge discovery kdd was started in montreal under aaai sponsorship it was cochaired by usama fayyad and ramasamy uthurusamy a year later in usama fayyad launched the journal by kluwer called datamining and knowledge discovery as its founding editorinchief later he started the sigkdd newsletter sigkdd explorations the kdd international conference became the primary highest quality conference in datamining with an acceptance rate of research paper submissions below the journal datamining and knowledge discovery is the primary research journal of the field
backgroundedit
the manual extraction of patterns from data has occurred for centuries early methods of identifying patterns in data include bayes theorem s and regression analysis s the proliferation ubiquity and increasing power of computer technology have dramatically increased data collection storage and manipulation ability as data sets have grown in size and complexity direct handson data analysis has increasingly been augmented with indirect automated data processing aided by other discoveries in computer science specially in the field of machinelearning such as neural networks cluster analysis genetic algorithms s decision trees and decision rules s and support vector machines s datamining is the process of applying these methods with the intention of uncovering hidden patterns in large data sets it bridges the gap from applied statistics and artificial intelligence which usually provide the mathematical background to database management by exploiting the way data is stored and indexed in databases to execute the actual learning and discovery algorithms more efficiently allowing such methods to be applied to everlarger data sets
processedit
the knowledge discovery in databases kdd process is commonly defined with the stages
selection
preprocessing
transformation datamining interpretationevaluation
it exists however in many variations on this theme such as the crossindustry standard process for datamining crispdm which defines six phases
business understanding
data understanding
data preparation
modeling
evaluation
deployment
or a simplified process such as preprocessing datamining and results validation
polls conducted in and show that the crispdm methodology is the leading methodology used by data miners the only other datamining standard named in these polls was semma however  times as many people reported using crispdm several teams of researchers have published reviews of datamining process models and azevedo and santos conducted a comparison of crispdm and semma in preprocessingedit
before datamining algorithms can be used a target data set must be assembled as datamining can only uncover patterns actually present in the data the target data set must be large enough to contain these patterns while remaining concise enough to be mined within an acceptable time limit a common source for data is a data mart or data warehouse preprocessing is essential to analyze the multivariate data sets before datamining the target set is then cleaned data cleaning removes the observations containing noise and those with missing data datamining edit datamining involves six common classes of tasks
anomaly detection outlierchangedeviation detection  the identification of unusual data records that might be interesting or data errors that require further investigation
association rule learning dependency modeling  searches for relationships between variables for example a supermarket might gather data on customer purchasing habits using association rule learning the supermarket can determine which products are frequently bought together and use this information for marketing purposes this is sometimes referred to as market basket analysis
clustering  is the task of discovering groups and structures in the data that are in some way or another similar without using known structures in the data
classification  is the task of generalizing known structure to apply to new data for example an email program might attempt to classify an email as legitimate or as spam
regression  attempts to find a function that models the data with the least error that is for estimating the relationships among data or datasets
summarization  providing a more compact representation of the data set including visualization and report generation
results validationedit
an example of data produced by data dredging through a bot operated by statistician tyler vigen apparently showing a close link between the best word winning a spelling bee competition and the number of people in the united states killed by venomous spiders the similarity in trends is obviously a coincidence datamining can unintentionally be misused and can then produce results that appear to be significant but which do not actually predict future behavior and cannot be reproduced on a new sample of data and bear little use often this results from investigating too many hypotheses and not performing proper statistical hypothesis testing a simple version of this problem in machinelearning is known as overfitting but the same problem can arise at different phases of the process and thus a traintest split when applicable at all may not be sufficient to prevent this from happening
the final step of knowledge discovery from data is to verify that the patterns produced by the datamining algorithms occur in the wider data set not all patterns found by datamining algorithms are necessarily valid it is common for datamining algorithms to find patterns in the training set which are not present in the general data set this is called overfitting to overcome this the evaluation uses a test set of data on which the datamining algorithm was not trained the learned patterns are applied to this test set and the resulting output is compared to the desired output for example a datamining algorithm trying to distinguish spam from legitimate emails would be trained on a training set of sample emails once trained the learned patterns would be applied to the test set of emails on which it had not been trained the accuracy of the patterns can then be measured from how many emails they correctly classify several statistical methods may be used to evaluate the algorithm such as roc curves
if the learned patterns do not meet the desired standards subsequently it is necessary to reevaluate and change the preprocessing and datamining steps if the learned patterns do meet the desired standards then the final step is to interpret the learned patterns and turn them into knowledge
researchedit
the premier professional body in the field is the association for computing machinerys acm special interest group sig on knowledge discovery and datamining sigkdd since this acm sig has hosted an annual international conference and published its proceedings and since it has published a biannual academic journal titled sigkdd explorations
computer science conferences on datamining include
cikm conference  acm conference on information and knowledge management
european conference on machinelearning and principles and practice of knowledge discovery in databases
kdd conference  acm sigkdd conference on knowledge discovery and datamining datamining topics are also present on many data managementdatabase conferences such as the icde conference sigmod conference and international conference on very large data bases
standardsedit
there have been some efforts to define standards for the datamining process for example the european cross industry standard process for datamining crispdm and the java datamining standard jdm development on successors to these processes crispdm and jdm was active in but has stalled since jdm was withdrawn without reaching a final draft
for exchanging the extracted models in particular for use in predictive analytics the key standard is the predictive model markup language pmml which is an xmlbased language developed by the datamining group dmg and supported as exchange format by many datamining applications as the name suggests it only covers prediction models a particular datamining task of high importance to business applications however extensions to cover for example subspace clustering have been proposed independently of the dmg
notable usesedit
main article examples of datamining see also categoryapplied datamining datamining is used wherever there is digital data available today notable examples of datamining can be found throughout business medicine science and surveillance
privacy concerns and ethicsedit
while the term datamining itself may have no ethical implications it is often associated with the mining of information in relation to peoples behavior ethical and otherwise
the ways in which datamining can be used can in some cases and contexts raise questions regarding privacy legality and ethics in particular datamining government or commercial data sets for national security or law enforcement purposes such as in the total information awareness program or in advise has raised privacy concerns datamining requires data preparation which uncovers information or patterns which compromise confidentiality and privacy obligations a common way for this to occur is through data aggregation data aggregation involves combining data together possibly from various sources in a way that facilitates analysis but that also might make identification of private individuallevel data deducible or otherwise apparent this is not datamining per se but a result of the preparation of data before and for the purposes of the analysis the threat to an individuals privacy comes into play when the data once compiled cause the data miner or anyone who has access to the newly compiled data set to be able to identify specific individuals especially when the data were originally anonymous
it is recommendedaccording to whom to be aware of the following before data are collected
the purpose of the data collection and any known datamining projects
how the data will be used
who will be able to mine the data and use the data and their derivatives
the status of security surrounding access to the data
how collected data can be updated
data may also be modified so as to become anonymous so that individuals may not readily be identified however even anonymized data sets can potentially contain enough information to allow identification of individuals as occurred when journalists were able to find several individuals based on a set of search histories that were inadvertently released by aol
the inadvertent revelation of personally identifiable information leading to the provider violates fair information practices
this indiscretion can cause financial
emotional or bodily harm to the indicated individual
in one instance of privacy violation the patrons of walgreens filed a lawsuit against the company in for selling
prescription information to datamining companies who in turn provided the data
to pharmaceutical companies
situation in europeedit
europe has rather strong privacy laws and efforts are underway to further strengthen the rights of the consumers however the useu safe harbor principles developed between and currently effectively expose european users to privacy exploitation by us companies as a consequence of edward snowdens global surveillance disclosure there has been increased discussion to revoke this agreement as in particular the data will be fully exposed to the national security agency and attempts to reach an agreement with the united states have failed
in the united kingdom in particular there have been cases of corporations using datamining as a way to target certain groups of customers forcing them to pay unfairly high prices these groups tend to be people of lower socioeconomic status who are not savvy to the ways they can be exploited in digital market places
situation in the united statesedit
in the united states privacy concerns have been addressed by the us congress via the passage of regulatory controls such as the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa the hipaa requires individuals to give their informed consent regarding information they provide and its intended present and future uses according to an article in biotech business week in practice hipaa may not offer any greater protection than the longstanding regulations in the research arena says the aahc more importantly the rules goal of protection through informed consent is approach a level of incomprehensibility to average individuals this underscores the necessity for data anonymity in data aggregation and mining practices
us information privacy legislation such as hipaa and the family educational rights and privacy act ferpa applies only to the specific areas that each such law addresses the use of datamining by the majority of businesses in the us is not controlled by any legislation
copyright lawedit
situation in europeedit
under european copyright and database laws the mining of incopyright works such as by web mining without the permission of the copyright owner is not legal where a database is pure data in europe it may be that there is no copyright but database rights may exist so datamining becomes subject to intellectual property owners rights that are protected by the database directive on the recommendation of the hargreaves review this led to the uk government to amend its copyright law in to allow content mining as a limitation and exception the uk was the second country in the world to do so after japan which introduced an exception in for datamining however due to the restriction of the information society directive the uk exception only allows content mining for noncommercial purposes uk copyright law also does not allow this provision to be overridden by contractual terms and conditions
since also switzerland has been regulating datamining by allowing it in the research field under certain conditions laid down by art d of the swiss copyright act this new article entered into force st of april the european commission facilitated stakeholder discussion on text and datamining in under the title of licences for europe the focus on the solution to this legal issue such as licensing rather than limitations and exceptions led to representatives of universities researchers libraries civil society groups and open access publishers to leave the stakeholder dialogue in may situation in the united statesedit
us copyright law and in particular its provision for fair use upholds the legality of content mining in america and other fair use countries such as israel taiwan and south korea as content mining is transformative that is it does not supplant the original work it is viewed as being lawful under fair use for example as part of the google book settlement the presiding judge on the case ruled that googles digitization project of incopyright books was lawful in part because of the transformative uses that the digitization project displayed one being text and datamining softwareedit
