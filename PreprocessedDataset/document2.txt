history
main article history of engineering
relief map of the citadel of lille designed in by vauban the foremost military engineer of his age
engineering has existed since ancient times when humans devised inventions such as the wedge lever wheel and pulley etc
the term engineering
is derived from the word engineer which itself dates back to the th century when an engineer literally one who builds or operates a siege engine referred to a constructor of military engines in this context now obsolete an engine referred to a military machine ie a mechanical contraption used in war for example a catapult notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps eg the us army corps of engineers
the word engine itself is of even older origin ultimately deriving from the latin ingenium c meaning innate quality especially mental power hence a clever invention
later as the design of civilian structures such as bridges and buildings matured as a technical discipline the term civil engineering entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such nonmilitary projects and those involved in the discipline of military engineering
ancient era
the ancient romans built aqueducts to bring a steady supply of clean and fresh water to cities and towns in the empire
the pyramids in ancient egypt ziggurats of mesopotamia the acropolis and parthenon in greece the roman aqueducts via appia and colosseum teotihuac n and the brihadeeswarar temple of thanjavur among many others stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of ancient civil and military engineers other monuments no longer standing such as the hanging gardens of babylon and the pharos of alexandria were important engineering achievements of their time and were considered among the seven wonders of the ancient world
the six classic simple machines were known in the ancient near east the wedge and the inclined plane ramp were known since prehistoric times the wheel along with the wheel and axle mechanism was invented in mesopotamia modern iraq during the th millennium bc the lever mechanism first appeared around years ago in the near east where it was used in a simple balance scale and to move large objects in ancient egyptian technology the lever was also used in the shadoof waterlifting device the first crane machine which appeared in mesopotamia circa bc and then in ancient egyptian technology circa bc the earliest evidence of pulleys date back to mesopotamia in the early nd millennium bc and ancient egypt during the twelfth dynasty bc the screw the last of the simple machines to be invented first appeared in mesopotamia during the neoassyrian period bc the egyptian pyramids were built using three of the six simple machines the inclined plane the wedge and the lever to create structures like the great pyramid of giza
the earliest civil engineer known by name is imhotep as one of the officials of the pharaoh djos r he probably designed and supervised the construction of the pyramid of djoser the step pyramid at saqqara in egypt around  bc the earliest practical waterpowered machines the water wheel and watermill first appeared in the persian empire in what are now iraq and iran by the early th century bc
kush developed the sakia during the th century bc which relied on animal power instead of human energyhafirs were developed as a type of reservoir in kush to store and contain water as well as boost irrigation sappers were employed to build causeways during military campaigns kushite ancestors built speos during the bronze age between and bcbloomeries and blast furnaces were also created during the th centuries bc in kush
ancient greece developed machines in both civilian and military domains the antikythera mechanism an early known mechanical analog computer and the mechanical inventions of archimedes are examples of greek mechanical engineering some of archimedes inventions as well as the antikythera mechanism required sophisticated knowledge of differential gearing or epicyclic gearing two key principles in machine theory that helped design the gear trains of the industrial revolution and are still widely used today in diverse fields such as robotics and automotive engineering
ancient chinese greek roman and hunnic armies employed military machines and inventions such as artillery which was developed by the greeks around the th century bc the trireme the ballista and the catapult in the middle ages the trebuchet was developed
middle ages
the earliest practical windpowered machines the windmill and wind pump first appeared in the muslim world during the islamic golden age in what are now iran afghanistan and pakistan by the th century ad the earliest practical steampowered machine was a steam jack driven by a steam turbine described in by taqi aldin muhammad ibn maruf in ottoman egypt
the cotton gin was invented in india by the th century ad and the spinning wheel was invented in the islamic world by the early th century both of which were fundamental to the growth of the cotton industry the spinning wheel was also a precursor to the spinning jenny which was a key development during the early industrial revolution in the th century
the earliest programmable machines were developed in the muslim world a music sequencer a programmable musical instrument was the earliest type of programmable machine the first music sequencer was an automated flute player invented by the banu musa brothers described in their book of ingenious devices in the th century in aljazari invented programmable automatarobots he described four automaton musicians including drummers operated by a programmable drum machine where they could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns the castle clock a hydropowered mechanical astronomical clock invented by aljazari was the first programmable analog computer
a waterpowered mine hoist used for raising ore ca before the development of modern engineering mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen such as millwrights clockmakers instrument makers and surveyors
aside from these professions universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology a standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise de re metallica which also contains sections on geology mining and chemistry
de re metallica was the standard chemistry reference for the next years
modern era
the application of the steam engine allowed coke to be substituted for charcoal in iron making lowering the cost of iron which provided engineers with a new material for building bridges
this bridge was made of cast iron which was soon displaced by less brittle wrought iron as a structural material
the science of classical mechanics sometimes called newtonian mechanics formed the scientific basis of much of modern engineering with the rise of engineering as a profession in the th century the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends similarly in addition to military and civil engineering the fields then known as the mechanic arts became incorporated into engineering
canal building was an important engineering work during the early phases of the industrial revolution
john smeaton was the first selfproclaimed civil engineer and is often regarded as the father of civil engineering he was an english civil engineer responsible for the design of bridges canals harbors and lighthouses he was also a capable mechanical engineer and an eminent physicist using a model water wheel smeaton conducted experiments for seven years determining ways to increase efficiency smeaton introduced iron axles and gears to water wheels smeaton also made mechanical improvements to the newcomen steam engine smeaton designed the third eddystone lighthouse  where he pioneered the use of hydraulic lime a form of mortar which will set under water and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse he is important in the history rediscovery of and development of modern cement because he identified the compositional requirements needed to obtain hydraulicity in lime work which led ultimately to the invention of portland cement
applied science lead to the development of the steam engine
the sequence of events began with the invention of the barometer and the measurement of atmospheric pressure by evangelista torricelli in demonstration of the force of atmospheric pressure by otto von guericke using the magdeburg hemispheres in laboratory experiments by denis papin who built experimental model steam engines and demonstrated the use of a piston which he published in edward somerset nd marquess of worcester published a book of inventions containing a method for raising waters similar to a coffee percolator
samuel morland a mathematician and inventor who worked on pumps left notes at the vauxhall ordinance office on a steam pump design that thomas savery read in savery built a steam pump called the miners friend it employed both vacuum and pressure iron merchant thomas newcomen who built the first commercial piston steam engine in was not known to have any scientific training jumbo jet
the application of steampowered cast iron blowing cylinders for providing pressurized air for blast furnaces lead to a large increase in iron production in the late th century
the higher furnace temperatures made possible with steampowered blast allowed for the use of more lime in blast furnaces which enabled the transition from charcoal to coke these innovations lowered the cost of iron making horse railways and iron bridges practical
the puddling process patented by henry cort in produced large scale quantities of wrought iron
hot blast patented by james beaumont neilson in greatly lowered the amount of fuel needed to smelt iron
with the development of the high pressure steam engine the power to weight ratio of steam engines made practical steamboats and locomotives possible new steel making processes such as the bessemer process and the open hearth furnace ushered in an area of heavy engineering in the late th century
one of the most famous engineers of the mid th century was isambard kingdom brunel who built railroads dockyards and steamships
offshore platform gulf of mexico
the industrial revolution created a demand for machinery with metal parts which led to the development of several machine tools boring cast iron cylinders with precision was not possible until john wilkinson invented his boring machine which is considered the first machine tool other machine tools included the screw cutting lathe milling machine turret lathe and the metal planer
precision machining techniques were developed in the first half of the th century
these included the use of gigs to guide the machining tool over the work and fixtures to hold the work in the proper position
machine tools and machining techniques capable of producing interchangeable parts lead to large scale factory production by the late th century
the united states census of listed the occupation of engineer for the first time with a count of there were fewer than engineering graduates in the us before in there were a dozen us mechanical engineering graduates with that number increasing to per year in in there were engineers in civil mining mechanical and electrical
there was no chair of applied mechanism and applied mechanics at cambridge until and no chair of engineering at oxford until germany established technical universities earlier
the foundations of electrical engineering in the s included the experiments of alessandro volta michael faraday georg ohm and others and the invention of the electric telegraph in and the electric motor in the theoretical work of james maxwell see maxwells equations and heinrich hertz in the late th century gave rise to the field of electronics the later inventions of the vacuum tube and the transistor further accelerated the development of electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other engineering specialty
chemical engineering developed in the late nineteenth century industrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by the need for large scale production of chemicals was such that a new industry was created dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants the role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes
the solar furnace at odeillo in the pyr n esorientales in france can reach temperatures up to  c  f
aeronautical engineering deals with aircraft design process design while aerospace engineering is a more modern term that expands the reach of the discipline by including spacecraft design its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the start of the th century although the work of sir george cayley has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the th century early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering
the first phd in engineering technically applied science and engineering awarded in the united states went to josiah willard gibbs at yale university in it was also the second phd awarded in science in the us
only a decade after the successful flights by the wright brothers there was extensive development of aeronautical engineering through development of military aircraft that were used in world war i meanwhile research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining theoretical physics with experiments

design of a turbine requires collaboration of engineers from many fields as the system involves mechanical electromagnetic and chemical processes the blades rotor and stator as well as the steam cycle all need to be carefully designed and optimized
in the engineering design process engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find novel solutions to problems or to improve existing solutions engineers need proficient knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects as a result many engineers continue to learn new material throughout their careers
if multiple solutions exist engineers weigh each design choice based on their merit and choose the solution that best matches the requirements the task of the engineer is to identify understand and interpret the constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result it is generally insufficient to build a technically successful product rather it must also meet further requirements
constraints may include available resources physical imaginative or technical limitations flexibility for future modifications and additions and other factors such as requirements for cost safety marketability productivity and serviceability by understanding the constraints engineers derive specifications for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated
problem solving
a drawing for a booster engine for steam locomotives engineering is applied to design with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science
engineers use their knowledge of science mathematics logic economics and appropriate experience or tacit knowledge to find suitable solutions to a particular problem creating an appropriate mathematical model of a problem often allows them to analyze it sometimes definitively and to test potential solutions
usually multiple reasonable solutions exist so engineers must evaluate the different design choices on their merits and choose the solution that best meets their requirements genrich altshuller after gathering statistics on a large number of patents suggested that compromises are at the heart of lowlevel engineering designs while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem
engineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to fullscale production they use among other things prototypes scale models simulations destructive tests nondestructive tests and stress tests testing ensures that products will perform as expected
engineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large engineers typically include a factor of safety in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure
the study of failed products is known as forensic engineering and can help the product designer in evaluating his or her design in the light of real conditions the discipline is of greatest value after disasters such as bridge collapses when careful analysis is needed to establish the cause or causes of the failure
computer use
a computer simulation of high velocity air flow around a space shuttle orbiter during reentry solutions to the flow require modelling of the combined effects of fluid flow and the heat equations
as with all modern scientific and technological endeavors computers and software play an increasingly important role as well as the typical business application software there are a number of computer aided applications computeraided technologies specifically for engineering computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes which can be solved using numerical methods
graphic representation of a minute fraction of the www demonstrating hyperlinks
one of the most widely used design tools in the profession is computeraided design cad software
it enables engineers to create d models d drawings and schematics of their designs cad together with digital mockup dmu and cae software such as finite element method analysis or analytic element method allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and timeconsuming physical prototypes
these allow products and components to be checked for flaws assess fit and assembly study ergonomics and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses temperatures electromagnetic emissions electrical currents and voltages digital logic levels fluid flows and kinematics access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of product data management software
there are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as computeraided manufacturing cam software to generate cnc machining instructions manufacturing process management software for production engineering eda for printed circuit board pcb and circuit schematics for electronic engineers mro applications for maintenance management and architecture engineering and construction aec software for civil engineering
in recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as product lifecycle management plm

robotic kismet can produce a range of facial expressions
the engineering profession engages in a wide range of activities from large collaboration at the societal level and also smaller individual projects
almost all engineering projects are obligated to some sort of financing agency a company a set of investors or a government
the few types of engineering that are minimally constrained by such issues are pro bono engineering and opendesign engineering
by its very nature engineering has interconnections with society culture and human behavior
every product or construction used by modern society is influenced by engineering the results of engineering activity influence changes to the environment society and economies and its application brings with it a responsibility and public safety
engineering projects can be subject to controversy examples from different engineering disciplines include the development of nuclear weapons the three gorges dam the design and use of sport utility vehicles and the extraction of oil in response some western engineering companies have enacted serious corporate and social responsibility policies
engineering is a key driver of innovation and human development subsaharan africa in particular has a very small engineering capacity which results in many african nations being unable to develop crucial infrastructure without outside aidcitation needed the attainment of many of the millennium development goals requires the achievement of sufficient engineering capacity to develop infrastructure and sustainable technological development
radar gps lidar are all combined to provide proper navigation and obstacle avoidance vehicle developed for darpa urban challenge
all overseas development and relief ngos make considerable use of engineers to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios a number of charitable organizations aim to use engineering directly for the good of mankind

engineering companies in many established economies are facing significant challenges with regard to the number of professional engineers being trained compared with the number retiring
this problem is very prominent in the uk where engineering has a poor image and low status there are many negative economic and political issues that this can cause as well as ethical issues it is widely agreed that the engineering profession faces an image crisis rather than it being fundamentally an unattractive career
much work is needed to avoid huge problems in the uk and other western economies still the uk holds most engineering companies compared to other european countries together with the united states
code of ethics
main article engineering ethics
many engineering societies have established codes of practice and codes of ethics to guide members and inform the public at large
the national society of professional engineers code of ethics states
engineering is an important and learned profession as members of this profession engineers are expected to exhibit the highest standards of honesty and integrity engineering has a direct and vital impact on the quality of life for all people accordingly the services provided by engineers require honesty impartiality fairness and equity and must be dedicated to the protection of the public health safety and welfare engineers must perform under a standard of professional behavior that requires adherence to the highest principles of ethical conduct
in canada many engineers wear the iron ring as a symbol and reminder of the obligations and ethics associated with their profession
relationships with other disciplines
science
scientists study the world as it is engineers create the world that has never been  theodore von k rm n
engineers scientists and technicians at work on target positioner inside national ignition facility nif target chamber
there exists an overlap between the sciences and engineering practice in engineering one applies science both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of materials and phenomena
both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observationscitation needed
scientists may also have to complete engineering tasks such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes conversely in the process of developing technology engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena thus becoming for the moment scientists or more precisely engineering scientistscitation needed
the international space station is used to conduct science experiments in space
in the book what engineers know and how they know it walter vincenti asserts that engineering research has a character different from that of scientific research
first it often deals with areas in which the basic physics or chemistry are well understood but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner
there is a real and important difference between engineering and physics as similar to any science field has to do with technology physics is an exploratory science that seeks knowledge of principles while engineering uses knowledge for practical applications of principles the former equates an understanding into a mathematical principle while the latter measures variables involved and creates technology for technology physics is an auxiliary and in a way technology is considered as applied physics though physics and engineering are interrelated it does not mean that a physicist is trained to do an engineers job a physicist would typically require additional and relevant training physicists and engineers engage in different lines of work but phd physicists who specialize in sectors of engineering physics and applied physics are titled as technology officer rd engineers and system engineers
an example of this is the use of numerical approximations to the navierstokes equations to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft or the use of the finite element method to calculate the stresses in complex components second engineering research employs many semiempirical methods that are foreign to pure scientific research one example being the method of parameter variationcitation needed
as stated by fung et al in the revision to the classic engineering text foundations of solid mechanics
engineering is quite different from science scientists try to understand nature engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature engineers stress innovation and invention to embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms and design something that people can use that something can be a complex system device a gadget a material a method a computing program an innovative experiment a new solution to a problem or an improvement on what already exists since a design has to be realistic and functional it must have its geometry dimensions and characteristics data defined
in the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions most often they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge thus they studied mathematics physics chemistry biology and mechanics often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession thus engineering sciences were born
although engineering solutions make use of scientific principles engineers must also take into account safety efficiency economy reliability and constructability or ease of fabrication as well as the environment ethical and legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution
medicine and biology
a tesla clinical mri scanner
the study of the human body albeit from different directions and for different purposes is an important common link between medicine and some engineering disciplines medicine aims to sustain repair enhance and even replace functions of the human body if necessary through the use of technology
genetically engineered mice expressing green fluorescent protein which glows green under blue light the central mouse is wildtype
modern medicine can replace several of the bodys functions through the use of artificial organs and can significantly alter the function of the human body through artificial devices such as for example brain implants and pacemakers the fields of bionics and medical bionics are dedicated to the study of synthetic implants pertaining to natural systems
conversely some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying and are dedicated to emulating many of its functions by replacing biology with technology this has led to fields such as artificial intelligence neural networks fuzzy logic and robotics
there are also substantial interdisciplinary interactions between engineering and medicine
both fields provide solutions to real world problems this often requires moving forward before phenomena are completely understood in a more rigorous scientific sense and therefore experimentation and empirical knowledge is an integral part of both
medicine in part studies the function of the human body the human body as a biological machine has many functions that can be modeled using engineering methods
the heart for example functions much like a pump the skeleton is like a linked structure with levers the brain produces electrical signals etc these similarities as well as the increasing importance and application of engineering principles in medicine led to the development of the field of biomedical engineering that uses concepts developed in both disciplines
newly emerging branches of science such as systems biology are adapting analytical tools traditionally used for engineering such as systems modeling and computational analysis to the description of biological systems
art
leonardo da vinci seen here in a selfportrait has been described as the epitome of the artistengineer he is also known for his studies on human anatomy and physiology
there are connections between engineering and art for example architecture landscape architecture and industrial design even to the extent that these disciplines may sometimes be included in a universitys faculty of engineering
the art institute of chicago for instance held an exhibition about the art of nasas aerospace design robert maillarts bridge design is perceived by some to have been deliberately artistic at the university of south florida an engineering professor through a grant with the national science foundation has developed a course that connects art and engineering
among famous historical figures leonardo da vinci is a wellknown renaissance artist and engineer and a prime example of the nexus between art and engineering
business
business engineering deals with the relationship between professional engineering it systems business administration and change management engineering management or management engineering is a specialized field of management concerned with engineering practice or the engineering industry sector
the demand for managementfocused engineers or from the opposite perspective managers with an understanding of engineering has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles during an engineering management course students will develop industrial engineering skills knowledge and expertise alongside knowledge of business administration management techniques and strategic thinking
engineers specializing in change management must have indepth knowledge of the application of industrial and organizational psychology principles and methods
professional engineers often train as certified management consultants in the very specialized field of management consulting applied to engineering practice or the engineering sector
this work often deals with large scale complex business transformation or business process management initiatives in aerospace and defence automotive oil and gas machinery pharmaceutical food and beverage electrical electronics power distribution generation utilities and transportation systems
this combination of technical engineering practice management consulting practice industry sector knowledge and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives these initiatives are typically sponsored by clevel executives
other fields
in political science the term engineering has been borrowed for the study of the subjects of social engineering and political engineering which deal with forming political and social structures using engineering methodology coupled with political science principles marketing engineering and financial engineering have similarly borrowed the term
